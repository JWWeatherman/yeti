# Goals:

- 5 of 5 multisig (maybe 4 of 4) should decay into 2 of 5 and then 1 of 5.
- Keys are never on the same hardware from generation to physical destruction.
- 3 locations must be compromised before the attacker can view your bitcoin
  transaction history.
- Signing takes place using a bootable CD disk and the hardware itself does not
  have persistent storage of any kind.
- Devices are not vulnerable to any RF transmissions as they are always inside
  a Faraday cage when in use or Faraday bag in storage.
- Unify the levels into a single setup that contains checking, savings and
  retirement and inheritence with approprate security for each.
- Incorporate blue wallet for you checking account with your own node. Single
  purpose phone or daily driver?
- Each seed should have some funds in a multisig with instructions for
  recovering it so that a thief is tempted to steal that amount and therefore
  announce their presence.
- Spending large amounts of bitcoin should take as long or longer than it would
  take to sell traditional assets and convert into bitcoin.

# Stretch Goals:

- An app that hires strangers to respond to you in an emergency.
- An app that sends some funds to a lawyer or private security firm under
  contract to use those funds towards prosecution of criminals.
